WTEM is a tool that extracts all localizable text from game saves to facilitate localization.  
It scans all region files and datapacks files within a save,
identifies text components (including plain text), and replaces them with translation components.
Currently, supports Minecraft 1.21.4+, with no plans to downgrade for older versions.

WTEM uses Minecraft's API for extraction and adopts a multi-version project structure.
Contributions are welcome to help maintain compatibility with newer versions.
